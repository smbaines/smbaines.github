        <h2>An In-Depth Analysis of the Risk of Concussions in the National Football League and the Impact of Player Safety on Youth Football</h2>
        <p> The NFL is America’s sport; any trend in the past two decades supports that the NFL has overtaken the MLB and NBA. In 2023, the NFL generated 18.7 billion dollars in revenue, while the MLB and NBA were each at 10.9 billion. Every time the NFL (or college football) comes around, you can feel a different scent in the air, and you can hear it on ESPN talk shows, social media, and general day-to-day interactions. From Patrick Mahomes to Lamar Jackson – quarterback controversies and debates probably invaded your Thanksgiving dinner. However, one issue continues to plague the NFL, and all of youth sports: concussions...</p>

        <p>As many know, football is a sport where there are frequent head-on collisions. When a running back takes the ball, oftentimes a defensive player will have a head start, and they are able to use their momentum and bare down on the player, making a forceful blow to the player’s head or neck area. That is essentially how a concussion occurs in football. For the formal definition of a concussion, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons defines it as “an injury to the brain that results in temporary loss of normal brain function.” Before we dive into my data, I found an interesting co-study from a group of scientists from the Massachusets General Hospital and Boston University, and they collected data from 631 male brain donors who had previously played football. The results, published in Nature Communications, found that 180 of them did not have CTE, 163 had low-stage CTE, and 288 had high-stage CTE, the latter being very alarming. I’ll get more into CTE later because that is the essence of my project.</p>

        <h2>Examining My First Data Set</h2>
        <p>Setting up the first part of my data, I want to talk about the recent safety measures that the NFL implemented. In the 2023 off-season, the NFL changed its kickoff rules to further reduce the rate of concussions. It is complicated, but to give the reader the bare bones of it, they have moved the kickoff team closer to the returning team to reduce the high-speed collision that would ensue after a kickoff. The less momentum the players get, the less likely there is to be a fatal blow to the head. 
            
            The other safety measure that was authorized was the option for players to wear guardian caps over their helmets. Guardian caps are large, soft tissue pads that get worn over helmets, with the hope that they will help reduce fatal head injuries. According to NFL Research, the cap can absorb at least 10% of the force of a hit.</p>

        <p>
            Looking at the NFL Concussion Data from 2015 to 2023, there has not been a significant change across the data, and the amount of concussions has stayed relatively stagnant from 2018-2023. However, it is encouraging that recent data is lower than it was from 2015 to 2017. I would argue that this is a result of the growing awareness regarding concussions and their detrimental long-term effects. According to Professor Shane Sanders, who teaches in Falk College at Syracuse University, the NFL will continue to be a high concussion rate sport due to the collisions and impacts that are a staple of the game. The recent player-safety changes have looked promising in the 2024 preseason, as the 44 concussions are a decrease of 24% from 2023.

        <h2>Impact on Youth Football</h2>
        <p>
            Switching gears, it’s become increasingly evident that there is a decline in the amount of kids playing tackle football among the younger generation. The heightened sensitivity around concussions has trickled down to families across America, and this data set illustrates that. In 2013, the percentage of kids ages 6-12 playing tackle football was at 3.5%. A decade later, that number has fallen to 2.7%. The correlation is clear – families are more hesitant to let their kids play tackle football. The inverse correlation is seen in flag football. It is no coincidence that the percentage of kids, aged 6-12 playing flag football has risen from 2.8% to 3.8% in the same period.</p>

        <p>Professor Sanders mentioned that the youth will continue to favor flag football over tackle, but he points out that there is also a negative correlation between the NFL and participation in youth football. The abatement of youth football has little effect on the revenue of the NFL, as the NFL is the highest-revenue sports league ever, and that number continues to rise.</p>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Case Study: Antonio Brown and CTE</h2>
        <p>Antonio Brown is one of the greatest NFL receivers to ever play, but his exotic behavior off the field has led many to believe that he suffers from CTE. It is first important to establish that CTE can only be definitively concluded after death when the subject’s brain is examined. In a game in 2022, Brown removed his uniform mid-game and stormed off the field, and that was the moment when the public began wondering if he did in fact have CTE. Now he is on social media, and some of the tweets and pictures that he posts are extremely offensive and disturbing.

        <p>An analysis from the Concussion Legacy Foundation explains that it is probable that Antonio Brown has CTE, but again, a definite conclusion cannot be made until after he is dead.</p>

    <section class="final">
        <h2>Tobacco Industry?</h2>
        <p>A pressing question that the public asks is if the NFL has a moral or legal obligation to reduce head injuries – is it their responsibility? Professor Sanders likened player safety regulations in the NFL to the tobacco industry. As the tobacco industry expanded, the health risks were not well understood. Once the effects were revealed, the industry went through a period of plausible deniability to protect itself in court. Eventually, tobacco companies operated without denying the health effects of their product. Sanders said that the OHSA – a federal agency that ensures safe working conditions – has treated the NFL differently. Antitrust laws likely impact how the OHSA can provide safety for players, but regardless, players are not protected by the federal agency.

        <p>To wrap up, football will always be a high concussion-risk sport, but I believe the NFL is making strides with player safety regarding the guardian caps and the new kickoff rules. Preseason data has been promising, and I expect 2024 regular season data to show a lower rate of concussions among players. The response to player safety among the youth has been eye-opening: I expect participation in tackle football to continue to decline while participation in flag football continues to climb. Lastly, It is beneficial – to all of society – that society is becoming more aware of the effects of CTE.</p>
